<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A Python script to export all the clippings from your Kindle device to a page in Notion. Run this script whenever you plug in your Kindle device to your PC. The underlying idea behind this idea is to marry the solitary reading experience of a Kindle with the note-taking capabilities of a cloud-based service like Notion.

A key inspiration behind this project was the notes saving feature on Google Play Books, which automatically syncs all your highlights from a book hosted on the service to a Google Doc in real time. I wanted a similar feature for my Kindle which unfortunately shows very narrow notetaking capabilities and a slow keyboard input. This project is one step towards a solution for this problem.

**Intended for**
- Avid readers who would want to browse through their prior reads and highlights anytime anywhere.
- For those who take notes alongside their highlights.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* A Kindle device.
* A Notion account to store your links.
* Python 3 on your system to run the code.

### Setup & Installation
 
1. Clone this repository.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/paperboi/Kindle2Notion.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory and install the pre-requisite packages using
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Plug in your Kindle device to your PC.
2. Duplicate this [database template](https://www.notion.so/paperboi/e62edc73c1a947ae8dbd775ec80cb5f9?v=9ce0c6c819714bba8c61551da05e42cb) to your Notion workspace.
3. Since this code requires access of non-public pages, an authentication token from your Notion page is required. This token is stored in the `token_v2` cookie. This can be found in the *Storage* tab of your browser's developer tools.
   - For Chrome: Open Developer Tools (*Menu > Other tools > Developer Tools*), navigate to Application tab and go to *Storage\Cookies* to find the token.
4. Store the path to your `MyClippings.txt` file, the address to your database and the `token_v2` value as `CLIPPINGS_FILE`, `NOTION_TABLE_ID` and `NOTION_TOKEN` respectively in a `.env` file (example provided in the repo) in the same directory you have cloned this repository to. 
5. To execute the script, navigate to the directory and run
   ```sh
   python kindle2notion.py
   ```
[**Note:** This code was tested on a Kindle Paperwhite.]
